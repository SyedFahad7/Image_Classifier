# <span style="color:blue">Image Classifier üñº</span>

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset.

## <span style="color:green">Overview</span>

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify whether an input image contains a cat or a dog. The model architecture is a CNN built using TensorFlow and Keras.

## <span style="color:green">Dataset</span>

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset, which consists of thousands of images of cats and dogs. The dataset is divided into training and test sets, with a balanced number of images for each class.

## <span style="color:green">Model Training</span>

The CNN model is trained using the training set of images. The training process involves feeding the images through the model, computing the loss function, and updating the model's weights using backpropagation. Training progress is monitored using metrics such as loss and accuracy.

## <span style="color:green">Model Evaluation</span>

After training, the model is evaluated using the test set of images to assess its performance on unseen data. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy are used to measure the model's performance.
